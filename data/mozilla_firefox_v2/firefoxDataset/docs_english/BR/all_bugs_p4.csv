882753|o Labels of specific combo boxes and list boxes are made insufficiently for JAWS to read|x86_64|Disability Access|17 Branch|2013-06-13T16:52:34Z|||User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; InfoPath.3; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)  Steps to reproduce:  When using the Tab key to access the "Show" combo box, JAWS v14.0.1823 reads it as "combo box text" and does not include "Show", the label of the text box.  By using the “Virtual cursor” mode, the label is also not made available for JAWS to read. JAWS also reads certain list boxes as "extended selected list box" and does not include the labels of the list boxes.   Actual results:  When using the Tab key to access the "Show" combo box, JAWS v14.0.1823 reads it as "combo box text" and does not include "Show", the label of the text box.  By using the “Virtual cursor” mode, the label is also not made available for JAWS to read. JAWS also reads certain list boxes as "extended selected list box" and does not include the labels of the list boxes.   Expected results:  Expected Result: When a specific user interface element is accessed via using the Tab key, all information about the element, including the label, is expected to be made sufficiently and accurate for JAWS to read.|2013-06-13T16:52:34Z

1154922|Tabs do not switch pressing ctrl+tab under Ubuntu 15.04 beta when browser.ctrlTab.previews = true|x86_64|Keyboard Navigation|40 Branch|2015-04-15T20:59:14Z|||On Ubuntu 15.04 (vivid), which is in beta, and a recent install of Firefox nightly 40.0a1 (2015-04-15) with no plugins enabled (including the ubuntu plugins).  In about:config set browser.ctrlTab.previews to true. Open more than two tabs so that the tab preview window will open during navigation. Press ctrl+tab. The tab preview opens, further presses of ctrl+tab cycle through tabs, but releasing the keys does not close the preview window and change tabs. I can press escape to close the window without switching tabs, and I can click a preview to change tabs, but I can not change tabs just by pressing and releasing ctrl+tab.  I also saw this behavior in the build of Firefox included in Ubuntu.|2015-04-15T20:59:14Z

1271766|Implement a way of determining which browser to import data from for auto-importing data on startup|Unspecified|Migration|Trunk|2016-05-10T20:11:10Z|||We could potentially use:  - the default browser if it isn't us (doesn't work if it's us) - rely on the existing ordering that is in use in the migrator dialog - actually determine which browsers have data available and migrate from the browser that has the most (potentially ignoring things like cookies or history, see e.g. bug 1226036 - if so, what should be ignored?)  Alternatively, we could import data from several browsers if we find it in there.  Verdi, do you have initial thoughts about what you would prefer?|2016-05-10T20:11:10Z
1271774|Figure out decisions about what to migrate for a/each browser when auto-importing data on startup|Unspecified|Migration|Trunk|2016-05-10T20:37:02Z|||+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1271766 +++  (bug 1271766 covers "which browser" which seems orthogonal in terms of implementation/philosophy)  Effectively, when auto-importing we'll need to make all the decisions we're now delegating to the user automatically.  Things we need to know:  - what browser(s) to import from. See bug 1271766.  - which data-types to import:   const unsigned short SETTINGS    = 0x0001;   const unsigned short COOKIES     = 0x0002;   const unsigned short HISTORY     = 0x0004;   const unsigned short FORMDATA    = 0x0008;   const unsigned short PASSWORDS   = 0x0010;   const unsigned short BOOKMARKS   = 0x0020;   const unsigned short OTHERDATA   = 0x0040;  (Note: not all of these are implemented for all 3rd-party browsers. We also support "SESSION" but not for any third-party browsers, as far as I can tell. We'll shortly add support for migrating add-ons from another Firefox profile, but that isn't immediately relevant here, either.)  I would suggest that we should import only form data, passwords, history and bookmarks.   I don't think we should actually bother importing cookies as they're often not very useful - I wouldn't expect them to help persist logged-in sessions to bigger sites like Facebook or Google, for instance, as both of those know "which browser" you log in with as well - and keeping them has tracking/advertisement downsides.  The settings we import for IE are of debatable usefulness (I thought there was a bug on file for this but I can't find it off-hand). The only other browser we seem to support this for is Safari, and at a glance, some of those settings (e.g. "allow me to store logins") seem like ones we shouldn't be auto-importing. Perhaps alternatively we just need to take a broom through those settings and then do import the ones that seem valuable? If so, that should probably be a separate bug.  OTHERDATA only gets you safari search strings. I don't know in what state that migrator is, we'd have to go test it, but it doesn't seem particularly valuable either.   - whether to import the homepage (this is a separate step in the wizard, so I'm listing it separately). I would suggest not to do this as it's unlikely to be useful, often hijacked, and it's easy for the user to restore if they really did want it.   - what profile to use. Both Chrome and 360SE seem to support multiple user profiles. I have no idea how to decide on which profile to use if there are multiple. I suppose if we detect this situation we could go back to showing the wizard, and we could auto-import if there's just the one? I doubt that importing from all the profiles is a reasonable solution here, and the "whole point" of this change is not to get in the user's face on startup, so asking also seems wrong. The only other thing I can think of is trying to work out which profile has the most data and basing it on that? Which seems like a pretty rubbishy strategy for user profiles moreso than for which browser to use (feels like multiple profiles has more user intent). I don't see anything in the code that indicates which of many profiles would be the default/current, either. :-\  Pinging :Verdi for thoughts / decisions here.|2016-05-10T20:37:02Z

1274712|Copy for string  changes to DNT dialog|Unspecified|Security|49 Branch|2016-05-20T22:51:52Z|[fxprivacy]||This bug can be used to decide on the new string to use the the DNT dialog.  Some options: When tracking protection is on, Firefox will send the DNT header. The DNT header is sent when Tracking Protection is enabled. When Tracking Protection is enabled, the DNT header is sent. Whenever Tracking Protection is enabled, the DNT header is sent.  We could potentially add a "Note:" at the beginning of the string.  The last string uses "whenever" to indicate that if Tracking Protection is just on in Private Browsing mode, then the DNT isn't sent automatically in regular mode.  +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1274654 +++  When TP is enabled, the DNT header is going to be sent per bug 1258033.  In order to communicate this to users, we need to make changes to the dialog that pops up when you click about:preferences#privacy "manage your DNT settings".  If TP is enabled globally, the DNT checkbox should be checked and grayed out so that the user can't uncheck it.  In addition, there should be some messaging to indicate that DNT is automatically turned on when TP is on.  There was a previous mockup for this here:  https://mozilla.invisionapp.com/share/QS7DW14A2#/screens/117954448_Dnt_State_2  Proposed string from previous mockup: When tracking protection is always on, Firefox will send the DNT header.  The above works when TP is enabled globally.  I'm not sure how we communicate that DNT is sent in private browsing mode.|2016-05-20T22:51:52Z
