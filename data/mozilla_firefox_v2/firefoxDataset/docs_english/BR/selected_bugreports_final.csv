Also see the note at the end concerning similar behavior in Thunderbird.  1. Click on the URL bar 2. Type 'Goog' 3. While typing, two types of suggestions will appear: 3.a. The bar will suggest goog[le.com] (the section in [  ] appears selected) 3.b. A dropdown also appears with other suggestions 4. After having clicked on the bar, the mouse may have 'accidently slid down' a little, to one of the dropdown suggestions. I don't care, because I don't want the suggestions. I press return.   1.

My mouse may slide down to one of the suggestions though, after I've clicked in the bar. 4. I decide I want to search for something else, so I select what I wrote (shift-control-arrow left) and press delete, so that I can type something else.

Expected results:  When I press a keyboard key such as return or delete, I expect it to have an effect on the area I'm typing in, not on what I'm mouse-hovering on. The current behavior is mixing two different input options, which is very confusing.   If I want to mouse-select, I'll mouse-hover and mouse-click.

That doesn't make any sense.  I *think* all the selectors for the passive mixed content icon should come first (and be combined), followed by a selector for the active mixed content cases.  If that is somehow not right, there really really needs to be a comment in the CSS that explains this... odd... sequence of rules, why there are separate ones, and why they override each other in the way that they do.  Paolo or Johann, can you take a look at what should happen here?

That doesn't make any sense.  I *think* all the selectors for the passive mixed content icon should come first (and be combined), followed by a selector for the active mixed content cases.
