2,windows_child_mode,48 Branch,Windows Child Mode,"Child mode is a feature of Windows that allows a parent (administrator) to set up a child account in order to monitor internet activity. It does so by using an SSL certificate that allows the operating system to spy or “MiTM” the child’s connections. While this helps the parent keep track of the child’s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.

Unlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system’s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.

The Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Windows_Child_Mode,windows_child_mode,"2 windows_child_mode 48 Branch Windows Child Mode Child mode is a feature of Windows that allows a parent (administrator) to set up a child account in order to monitor internet activity.

3,apz_async_scrolling,48 Branch,APZ - Async Scrolling,"The Async Pan/Zoom module (APZ) is a platform component that allows panning and zooming to be performed asynchronously (on the compositor thread rather than the main thread).

For zooming, this means that the APZ reacts to a pinch gesture immediately and instructs the compositor to scale the already-rendered layers at whatever resolution they have been rendered (so e.g. text becomes more blurry as you zoom in), and meanwhile sends a request to Gecko to re-render the content at a new resolution (with sharp text and all).

For panning, this means that the APZ asks Gecko to render a portion of a scrollable layer, called the ""display port"", that's larger than the visible portion. It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport. (The displayport can also be used when zooming out causes more content of a scrollable layer to be shown than before.)",https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/APZ,apz_async_scrolling,"3 apz_async_scrolling 48 Branch APZ - Async Scrolling The Async Pan/Zoom module (APZ) is a platform component that allows panning and zooming to be performed asynchronously (on the compositor thread rather than the main thread).

12,pointer_lock_api,50 Branch,Pointer Lock API,"The Pointer Lock API (formerly called Mouse Lock API) provides input methods based on the movement of the mouse over time (i.e., deltas), not just the absolute position of the mouse cursor in the viewport. It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.

More than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.

Pointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.

13,webm_eme,50 Branch,WebM EME support for Widevine,"Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) is a JavaScript API for playing DRMed video content in HTML. A DRM component called a Content Decryption Module (CDM) decrypts, decodes, and displays the video. A JavaScript program coordinates the process using the EME API to pass messages between the CDM and a server that provides decryption keys and content.

Hollywood studios require companies that license movies for streaming use DRM between the streaming company and the end user. On the Web, this has traditionally been done by using the Microsoft PlayReady DRM component inside the Silverlight plug-in or the Adobe Access DRM component inside the Flash Player.
