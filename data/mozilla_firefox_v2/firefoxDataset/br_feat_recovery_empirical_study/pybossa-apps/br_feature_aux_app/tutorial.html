                <p>Hi, welcome to the tutorial of this project. Below we explain how you can contribute.</p>

                <p>
                    On the left side of your screen appear the <strong style="color:red">bug report</strong> and the most relevant data about it, which you
                    must consider on your task. Your task consists in reading the bug title (<strong>bug summary</strong> field) and the detailed
                    description (<strong>bug reporter comment</strong> field) and to mark on the right side of your screen
                    the Mozilla Firefox's <strong style="color:red">features</strong> you think exists an association or relationship with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will find next to each feature a question mark <a id="doubt_icon">?</a> that you can click and read the detailed
                    description of that feature and a link to additional information that you may need to understand the feature. Please pay
                    attention to the feature's complete description, once it may contain <strong>many software components</strong> involved and one of them
                    is the one that creates the relationship with the bug report.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important topic</strong>: We consider that a bug report is associated with a given feature if there is some mention to
                    that feature in the bug summary or in the bug reporter comment. Or if you think, after reading the feature description, that the relationship
                    may exist. This is not an exact science, and right answers may not exist for some relationships so we need your cognitive skills
                    to determine it. <strong style="color:red"><i>Any feature that may be impacted by the bug report or is cited into its description should be considered as
                    related or associated to it even if the feature belongs to another version than the one pointed out in the bug report.</i></strong>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Important topic 2</strong>: <i>A bug report also may be associated with more than one feature at the same time. Mark all the related features if it is the case.</i></p>
                <p>
                    Below the bug reporter comment, you have a link to the bug report with a better text formatting in the Bugzilla platform.
