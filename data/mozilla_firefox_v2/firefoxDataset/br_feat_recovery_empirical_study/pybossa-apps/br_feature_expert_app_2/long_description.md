Welcome! First of all, thank you for agreeing into participate of our study.

The purpose of this study is to indicate the relationship or association that may exist between a **feature** of the well know internet browser Mozilla Firefox and a given **bug report**.

In this application, which was created exclusively for this empirical study, you will be presented with a bug report, collected from the [Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org), the Mozilla's bug tracking system, and a list of features developed and tested in the versions 48 to 51 of the Mozilla Firefox.

Detailed descriptions and external links of each listed feature are provided for you. Also, you can access the original description of the bug report at Bugzilla through a provided link to it, so you can have additional information to guess about the **_possible_** relationship between the two artifacts.
