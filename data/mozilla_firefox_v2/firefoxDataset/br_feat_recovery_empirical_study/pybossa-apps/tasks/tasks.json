For each add-on, we would show its status:  - e10s compatible (doesn't use CPOWs at all) - e10s functional (works, uses CPOWs, probably will make Firefox slower) - broken with e10s  For each add-on not in the first category, we'd like to provide alternatives: - disable the add-on - upgrade to a beta version that works better - upgrade to a slightly different add-on (Firebug 2 -> Firebug 3 for example)  We would probably also show this UI whenever the status of an add-on changes (for example a disabled add-on being made e10s-compatible).",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

Actual results:  After the browser restarted, I noticed that \"Recently bookmarked\" thing with several recently bookmarked bookmarks appeared in my bookmarks, occupying the top slots and wasting space.    Expected results:  The way to disable this thing as I don't need this.  I use Firefox few years already and never in my life have seen this thing before, until now, but the posts on Google shows it appeared in 2008 already, so I guess there has been already a way to disable it before and I had it disabled all the time until the newest Nightly appeared and somehow reactivated it (without my permission). But how to disable it again ?  I tried to disable it, but it seems that you can not turn this off, as I searched Google and most of the solutions were to delete it by clicking on it and selecting \"delete\" or by going to Library by clicking on \"Show all bookmarks\" or Ctrl + Shift + B and deleting \"Recently bookmarked\" folder but this does not work in the both cases - when I click on it, there is no \"delete\" option as there is when clicking on regular bookmarks, and in the second case there is no \"Recently bookmarked\" folder in Library.

Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

(It may help if you first do full-page-zoom so that content overflows in a more extreme way.)   3. Scroll the page to the right, horizontally.  ACTUAL RESULTS: The region of the page that you scroll into view has a *white background*.  So, you end up with white/gray text on a white background, which is hard to read (and looks pretty broken).  EXPECTED RESULTS: Page background should be consistently the same color, even if some content overflows.",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

As you might know, this is the default matching mode for the find toolbars in Webkit/ Blink based browsers.  The implementation uses the term 'entireword', not 'wholeword' as you might think. This is due to historical reasons that are not very interesting for this bug ;-)",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

Also see the note at the end concerning similar behavior in Thunderbird.  1. Click on the URL bar 2. Type 'Goog' 3. While typing, two types of suggestions will appear: 3.a. The bar will suggest goog[le.com] (the section in [  ] appears selected) 3.b. A dropdown also appears with other suggestions 4. After having clicked on the bar, the mouse may have 'accidently slid down' a little, to one of the dropdown suggestions. I don't care, because I don't want the suggestions. I press return.   1. Click on the search bar 2. Type 'Goog' 3. While typing, suggestions will appear in the dropdown. I don't care about them, because I want to type something new. My mouse may slide down to one of the suggestions though, after I've clicked in the bar. 4. I decide I want to search for something else, so I select what I wrote (shift-control-arrow left) and press delete, so that I can type something else.    Actual results:  The mouse-hovered item is affected, rather than the typed one.  - In the case of the url bar, [return] navigates to the hover-over item instead of what's in the url bar.  - In the case of the search bar, [delete] deletes the hovered-over search suggestion instead of the word I typed and selected.   Expected results:  When I press a keyboard key such as return or delete, I expect it to have an effect on the area I'm typing in, not on what I'm mouse-hovering on. The current behavior is mixing two different input options, which is very confusing.   If I want to mouse-select, I'll mouse-hover and mouse-click. If I want to keyboard-select, I'll keyboard-arrow-down and keyboard-return. If I want to delete, I'll keyboard-arrow-down and keyboard-(shift-)delete.   Whatever the case, I don't expect what I'm hovering over to be \"selected\". I'm only \"hovering\".....   This may be related to Bug 1176107 and/or Bug 1283398.   [NOTE] I experience the same issue in Thunderbird, it actually has even worse implications there. I may type \"Ma\" in the To: field and see that \"Maarten\" is pre-filled, which is great because he's who I want. My mouse may have slid down to another option starting with \"Ma\" though, but it wouldn't cross my mind that when I now click in the body of my email, or press \"Send\", that it will secretly change the To-field and send my email to who I was hovering over rather than to who actually appeared as typed-in!   This behavior did not occur a year ago (maybe a little more), so a relatively recent change caused hovered-over items to be considered to be 'selected'.",

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store.

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

Expected results:  Per discussion in bug 1294496: we don't want to enable search suggestions for \"foo\" if the nsIDefaultURIFixup component suggests that \"foo\" is whitelisted, to avoid privacy issues. This is the case both when \"foo\" is individually whitelisted and when the dns_first pref is flipped (which means nsIDefaultURIFixup will return true for any host when asked isDomainWhitelisted) .   However, search suggestions *for multiple words* or when the first word is clearly not a domain should work even with this option enabled.  The original patch and review for this were done in bug 1294496.",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

Actual results:  Note the value for `defaultUpdateChannel` is `release`.  I understand that RC should be as close to the final release as possible, which is probably why this occurs.

The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

That doesn't make any sense.  I *think* all the selectors for the passive mixed content icon should come first (and be combined), followed by a selector for the active mixed content cases.  If that is somehow not right, there really really needs to be a comment in the CSS that explains this... odd... sequence of rules, why there are separate ones, and why they override each other in the way that they do.

Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

Not sure how hard that may be, but we really need to not regress this.  The operations to test are: 1. type something that will execute a search ENTER 2. Enter on a search suggestion from the popup 3. click on a search suggestion in the popup 4. enter on a one-off button 5. click on a one-off button 6. one-off search settings button should not increase the counter  Also keywords (bookmarks and search engine aliases), we may double count them, so it's worth testing those too.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

Looking at the general flow of removing tabs:  1. `_beginRemoveTab` is called  a. The tab is added to `this._removingTabs` array  b. `TabClose` event is emitted  c. `aTab._endRemoveArgs` is set 2. `_endRemoveTab` is called  a. If `!aTab!aTab._endRemoveArgs`, abort  b. Remove the tab from `this._removingTabs` array  c. If `aCloseWindow`, loop over all tabs in `this._removingTabs` array and call `_endRemoveTab`  The issue I saw is that listeners for `TabClose` can trigger arbitrary behavior, including removing a second tab, leading to follow timeline of actions:  1. `_beginRemoveTab` is called for tab 1 2. Tab 1 is added to `this._removingTabs` array   * NOTE: `_endRemoveArgs` has _not_ been set for tab 1 yet 3. `TabClose` event emitted for tab 1 4. Some `TabClose` listener calls `removeTab(tab2)` 5. `_beginRemoveTab` is called for tab 2 6. `_endRemoveTab` is called for tab 2, close window is true 7. Loop over all tabs in `this._removingTabs` array and call `_endRemoveTab`   * Here we loop forever, because the `this._removingTabs` contains a tab without `_endRemoveArgs` so it just returns immediately  I tried to adjust the timing of when `_endRemoveArgs` is set, but I couldn't find the precise point to do so without its own negative effects.",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

The stronger UI (in context, which is a number of the child bugs under Bug #1217142) will go through some testing (via Heartbeat) first to ensure it does as intended.  The strategy for getting more developers to move to HTTPS is as follows: - Do a Heartbeat study on how users would perceive the in-context insecure password UI - Publish the results of that study, targeted at developers (encouraging them to move to HTTPS) and a description of the changes that are coming - Roll out this (more minor) change in v51 - In a future release, roll out the in-context UI changes",

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

Went to https://www.paypal.com 2. Clicked on the green padlock on the URL bar (next to it, it correctly displays \"PayPal, Inc. (US)\"), but nothing was displayed. 3. Clicked on Tools -> Page Info -> Security tab, but nothing is displayed (as indicated in the attached screenshot). Clicking on any of the buttons (View Certificate, View Cookies, and View Saved Passwords) does nothing (for this website, works for others). 4. Disabled all extensions and add-ons and tried again, no success. 5. Cleared all cookies for the paypal domain, still nothing. 6. Opened a Private Window from the same profile, still nothing. 7. Used a different profile, information is displayed normally (both next to the padlock, and on the Page Info tab, with website identity, privacy, technical details, etc.).    Actual results:  No information is displayed when clicking on the green padlock for that website, or on the Security tab of the Page Info window.  It only happens for this specific website (from all those I've tried, with https), and only on one specific profile (my main one).  The reason I'm filling the bug is because PayPal is a security-sensitive website, so I'd like to know if my profile could be corrupted or affected by some malware.  If there is a way to clean my profile other than starting from scratch, would gladly like to know. Otherwise, if there is a way to obtain debugging information, that would help.   Expected results:  Security information should be displayed normally in both profiles, or some error message should help explain why it can't be shown.",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen.

From Tanvi:  Taipei team came out with a few proposals on how we could change the tab highlighting here - https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ywv6f2ty6s74en/Container%20Tab%20proposal.png?dl=0.  We know overline is a problem, so that throws out 1-3.  And 6 just looks odd to me.  So I'm in favor of 4 or 5 - pretty much changing our overline in mozilla-central to an underline, as John proposed. If we can get an underline that is the full tab width (proposal 5), then that would be great.  But if not, we can underline a portion of the tab (proposal 4).  Can you add these details to that bug?  If its simple to implement and not particularly risky, we can try to uplift to 51 (beta).",

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

Edge shows a splash screen (an idea which we've evaluated and discarded).  By showing a window more quickly, we also (I believe) get the Firefox icon into the taskbar more quickly.  We should be using Edge as our timing benchmark here, since it appears to be fastest. The request from UX is that we beat or at least be at parity with Edge on showing something after startup.

The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It also leads to some hacky work-arounds in the webext code.    This could be resolved by adding a position param to addTab, and passing a position in from those areas that use moveTabTo for positioning the tab.  The tab could be inserted where it is meant to be, rather than inserted then moved.  This would also provide us with a correct tab index upon creation.  Outside of webextensions, I see no areas that depend on a combination tab created/moved event sequence.    I need to review TabMove listeners to see if any would break, but if they do, they are likely listening for the wrong event anyway (e.g. should listen for add/attach/etc), possibly for the same reason we attempt to work around this in webextensions.",

While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport.

It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",

                "feature_description": "Child mode is a feature of Windows that allows a parent (administrator) to set up a child account in order to monitor internet activity. It does so by using an SSL certificate that allows the operating system to spy or \u201cMiTM\u201d the child\u2019s connections. While this helps the parent keep track of the child\u2019s activity, it presents a fundamental problem for the way Firefox works.\n\nUnlike other browsers, Firefox does not use the system\u2019s SSL certificates to verify connections, but instead, relies on its own certificate store. Since this Microsoft certificate is not present here, Firefox will see these connections as untrusted, and the user of the child account will not be able to view secure sites. The solution is to import this Microsoft certificate only when Firefox detects that it is running in child mode.\n\nThe Windows Child Mode compatibility feature also includes modifications on Bookmarks and History control, Add-Ons control, WebGL Compatibility (based on WebGL library for graphic/image renderization) and PDF files compatibility (read, save/download, print, navigate).",

It then reacts to a pan gesture immediately, asking the compositor to render a different portion of the displayport (or, if the displayport is not large enough to cover the new visible region, then nothing in the portions it doesn't cover - this is called checkerboarding), and eanwhile sends a request to Gecko to render a new displayport. (The displayport can also be used when zooming out causes more content of a scrollable layer to be shown than before.)",

It gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view. It is ideal for first person 3D games, for example.\n\nMore than that, the API is useful for any applications that require significant mouse input to control movements, rotate objects, and change entries, for example allowing users to control the viewing angle simply by moving the mouse around without any button clicking. The buttons are then freed up for other actions. Other examples include apps for viewing maps or satellite imagery.\n\nPointer lock lets you access mouse events even when the cursor goes past the boundary of the browser or screen. For example, your users can continue to rotate or manipulate a 3D model by moving the mouse without end. Without Pointer lock, the rotation or manipulation stops the moment the pointer reaches the edge of the browser or screen. Game players can now click buttons and swipe the mouse cursor back and forth without worrying about leaving the game play area and accidentally clicking another application that would take mouse focus away from the game.\n\n",
